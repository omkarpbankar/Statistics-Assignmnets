    "To solve this problem, we can use a much smaller number for the number of people who are boarding the plane. So let’s say there are only two people boarding the plane with the 1st passenger’s assigned seat is A and the 2nd passenger’s assigned seat is B. If the 1st passenger, who seats randomly and takes A as his seat, then the 2nd passenger will take B as his seat. In this case, the 2nd passenger sits in the correct seat. However, if the 1st passenger, who sit randomly, takes B as his seat, then the 2nd passenger will have to take A as his seat. In this case, the 2nd passenger sits in the wrong seat. We see that if there are 2 passengers, the probability that the last passenger (i.e., the 2nd passenger) sits in the right seat is 1/2.\n",
